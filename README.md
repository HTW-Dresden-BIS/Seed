**SEED - Sintesizer for Enterprise Experimentation Data**

This is a product generator for realistic enterprise data. The generated gizontograph is based on structural indicatiors that can be retrieved by analysing real enterprise data or estimated for wide range of experiments. Operations are created and distributed over machines based on a transition matrix that is able to shift the organizational degree seemlesly between 0 (Job Shop) and 1 (Flow shop).

ToDo:
Questions to answer:
- [ ] Lambda required ? (id does almost nothing but determing from which side the procedure is coming close to the target value )
- [ ] Randomizing required ? (implemented but not required.)
- [ ] Start for Flowshop always M1 ? (it will create a static amount of operations n that is equal to amout of resources for all materials) 
- [ ] Forbid to jump from source to sink ?
